================================================================
This file represents the structure of code for the project
================================================================

The inital effort is to organize the project modulewise. The modules included are:
* Input module (responsible for capturing and video/image input management)
* Imageprocessing module (responsible for extracting the region of interest)
* Event module (responsible to monitor the events)

The modulewise representation and software flow is as follows:
* Input Module:
** class VideoHandler has a class stream

* Imageproc Module:
** class preprocess accesses classes of Input Module and has a class Extractfeatures which has a class Postprocess.

* Event Module:
** class Event can access classes of Imageproc Module and has classes for individual events.

The respective code(s) are given in the src folder. 

Note: This is a project under development.
